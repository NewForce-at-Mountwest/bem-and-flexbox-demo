## Lightning Exercise 1
- Create a new file called `index.html`
- In your `index.html` file, use the shift + ! shortcut to generate boilerpalte HTML.
- Create the following elements in your HTML file:
    - A `nav` element
        - Inside the `nav` element, create four `a` elements. Give each `a` element some text that you might see in a nav bar. "Home", "About Me", etc. You can just give each href attribute a value of "#" for the moment.

## Lightning Exercise 2 
- Create a file called `style.css` and link to your HTML file.
- Give your nav bar and your nav elements appropriate BEM classes
- In `style.css`, apply the following styles:
    - Nav elements should be spaced evenly across the top of the page (hint: use flexbox! https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
    - Nav elements should have black text
    - Nav elements should have Helvetica font
    - Nav elements should not have any underline (hint: use the `text-decoration` property)
